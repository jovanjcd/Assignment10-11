The code present within this project belogns to various online sources in regards to certain
classes, methods, and most the html formatting in combination with various modifcations 
meant to make the project adhere to the requirements of the assignment.

1. Real Python's article "Discover Flask, Part 2 â€“ Creating a Login Page"
(https://realpython.com/introduction-to-flask-part-2-creating-a-login-page/)
The log_in method was created by Real Python, and was modifed slightly for the inclusion of the url 
redircet towards the gate_way webpage I included as a way for users to pick which feed they wanted to see.
Everything outside of that line was a product of their work.

2. Miguel Grinberg's article" Video Streaming with Flask"
(https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask) &
log0's blog post "Python Live Video Streaming Example"
(http://www.chioka.in/python-live-video-streaming-example/)
Miguel Grinberg created the example code which includes the gen and video_feed methods. The later
I utilized and changed into the static_feed and live_feed methods. For the gen method I 
utilized log0's modifed version of it as opposed to the original. The Video Camera class and all of 
its methods were the product of log0's work. The only change I made regarding this section of code was 
the removal of the Video Capture method call that would acess my system's camera, and the creation of 
a VideoCmaera2 child class that was dedicated to the camrea feed.
